// A nym contains a list of credential sets.
// The whole purpose of a Nym is to be an identity, which can have
// master credentials.
//
// Each CredentialSet contains list of Credentials. One of the
// Credentials is a MasterCredential, and the rest are ChildCredentials
// signed by the MasterCredential.
//
// A Credential may contain keys, in which case it is a KeyCredential.
//
// Credentials without keys might be an interface to a hardware device
// or other kind of external encryption and authentication system.
//
// Non-key Credentials are not yet implemented.
//
// Each KeyCredential has 3 OTKeypairs: encryption, signing, and authentication.
// Each OTKeypair has 2 OTAsymmetricKeys (public and private.)
//
// A MasterCredential must be a KeyCredential, and is only used to sign
// ChildCredentials
//
// ChildCredentials are used for all other actions, and never sign other
// Credentials
